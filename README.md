# Encrypted LoRa Communication - Gateway

This repository includes code a Raspberry Pi Model B.
The Raspberry Pi (Gateway). The LoRa commincation parameters are adjustable. Default settings are LoRa Frequency 868,1 MHz, Spreading Factor SF7 and Coding Rate 4/5. LoRa Communication is possible encrypted and without encryption. Right now the encrypted LoRa payload is limited to 16 Bytes.

## Usage
The code should demostrate a way of using the LoRa Radio Technology for sending data encrypted. Also it is a fast introduction to the LoRa Technology. 

## Goal
The goal was to develop a Node to Gateway encrypted communiction with the LoRa Radio technolagy. (Not LoRaWan)


## Software Dependencies 
The code requires the following software libraries.

### for the Gateway
* enable SPI -> check in  ```$ raspi-config``` on RPi 
* WiringPi: to access GPIO -> install ```$ sudo apt-get install wiringpi```
* start program as root ``$ sudo ./main``

## Setup and Installation

### for the Gateway
1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi ```git clone https://github.com/rokigeorg/encrypted-LoRa-Communication.git ``` 
2. Wire up the Raspberry Pi with the second RFM95 LoRa Modul (see section Hardware Wiring)
3. On the command line in our repository folder  ``$ cd HopeRF_LoRa_Receiver``
4. Compile the code via the Makefile ``$ make``
5. Run the LoRa Radio Receiver ``$ sudo ./main -f 868100000 -sf 7 -cr 5 -bw 125 -o received_data.txt`` 

Please note the adjustable arguments 
```
-f 868100000
 ``` 
 specifizes the frequency
 ```
 -sf 7
 ``` 
 specifizes the spreadig factor SF7
  ```
 -cr 5
 ``` 
 specifizes the coding rate 4/5
 
   ```
  -bw 125
  ``` 
specifizes the bandwidth 125 kHz
 
   ```
  -o 125
  ``` 
specifizes the output file. Received payload will be written to the end of the file.

All parameters can be adjusted. The given values are only the default values.

## Hardware 
The code functions with the following hardware components.
* 2 x HopeRF RFM95 - Low Power Long Range Transceiver Module V1.0 
* Raspberry Pi - Model B
* Arduino Uno

## In progress
The following features need to be implemeted
* forward payload to server

## History
For my bachelor thesis I try to build a Low-cost-Gateway for a LoRa Network. Currently I am supported by the Labb - Laboratory for Biosignal Processing in Leipzig Germany.
